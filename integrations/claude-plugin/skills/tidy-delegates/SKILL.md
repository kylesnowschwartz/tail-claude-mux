# tidy-delegates — sweep finished delegate windows

Close the finished TCM codex delegate windows left over from `tcm-delegate`
runs.

Scope is the current tmux session by default (`--all-sessions` widens it). The
sweep is deterministic and fails safe: it only targets windows whose pane start
command carries the `codex --profile tcm-delegate` spawn signature, and by
default only closes ones whose TCM status is terminal (done/error/interrupted/
gone). Running or approval-waiting delegates, and windows you opened yourself,
are never touched.

Arguments — pass ONLY the recognized flags below that Kyle actually supplied,
each as its own literal token. Never splice raw `$ARGUMENTS` (or any free text,
shell operator, `;`, `|`, `$(...)`, or glob) into the command line; if Kyle's
request contains anything other than these flags, drop it and, if it looks
intentional, ask him. `--keep`'s value must be a non-negative integer.

- `--all-sessions` — sweep every tmux session, not just the current one
- `--keep N` — preserve the N most-recent delegate windows
- `--all` — close every matched delegate regardless of status (interrupts live work)
- `--dry-run` — print what would close, change nothing

## Step 1 — preview first (changes nothing)

ALWAYS run the dry-run before anything else, and read its output. Never run the
real sweep before inspecting this preview — the preview is the only thing
standing between a done-but-unread delegate and a closed window.

```sh
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/tidy-delegates.sh --dry-run [only the recognized flags Kyle supplied]
```

## Step 2 — review, then act

- Default to holding fire. If you cannot positively confirm that every window
  in the preview has already had its output consumed — or if any is worth
  keeping for reference — do NOT close anything. Name those windows, say why
  you're holding fire, and ask Kyle first. A fresh tidy invocation usually
  lacks the context to know what's been read, so uncertainty means ask.
- Only when every previewed window is confirmed safe to close, run the sweep
  for real and report the one-line result (closed / kept / skipped, and the
  scope):

  ```sh
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/tidy-delegates.sh [only the recognized flags Kyle supplied]
  ```

Do not add `--all` or `--all-sessions` unless Kyle asked for them.

This closes windows only — it does not remove any worktree the delegate ran in.
Sweep those separately per `tcm-delegate` §4 (`git worktree remove` / `prune`).
